# 🧬 Inferential SQL Injection Using the Bernstein-Vazirani Quantum Algorithm

This project explores an innovative method of performing **Inferential SQL Injection** attacks by leveraging the **Bernstein-Vazirani quantum algorithm**. It demonstrates a quantum-enhanced approach to exploit SQL vulnerabilities, using boolean logic and pattern inference embedded within quantum computation.

The experiment targets the SQL injection vector in **OWASP WebGoat**, a vulnerable web application designed for training and demonstration purposes. By injecting boolean-based payloads and applying the **Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm**, the attack simulates solving the "hidden string problem"—revealing how quantum techniques can potentially amplify traditional attack methods in the post-NISQ era.
