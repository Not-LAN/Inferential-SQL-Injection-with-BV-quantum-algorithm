# Inferential SQL Injection using Bernstein-Vazirani quantum algloritm 

This code belongs to an experiment presenting a new method to perform Inferential SQL Injections using the advantages offered by the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in a quantum device. It will examine the SQL vulnerability vector contained in WebGoat training tool, a vulnerable web application from OWASP's Broken Web Application Project showing a possible way for exploiting it by injecting boolean conditions and at the same time triggering the hidden secret string problem in which the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is applied.

## Deployment

To run this project from a terminal using jupyter notebook:

- Firstly, you need to convert the jupyter notebook file which is in the format .ipynb to .py format using the jupyter nbconvert tool.
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to <output format> <input notebook>
```

 Whereas, the <output format> is the desired output format. And the <input notebook> is the jupyter notbook filename.

- Verify whether .py file is created in your working directory.

- Finally, you could run a jupyter notebook .ipynb file from command prompt using the converted .py file as shown below.

```bash
   python MyFirstNotebook.py
```
